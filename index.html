<!-- 
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements
In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements. -->

<!-- With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page -->

<!-- Let's try some new things! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<h1>*Fun With JavaScript*</h1>

	<h2>With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.</h2>

	<h3>Two for Testing: document.write and console.log</h3>

	<h4>Using document.write</h4>

	<p>Here's a number and a random word:</p>
	<!-- document.write is great for testing-->
	<script>
		document.write(5 + 7);
	</script>
	<script>
		document.write('potato');
	</script>

	<br>

	<br>

	<p>Here's the current date:</p>
	<script>
		document.write(Date());
	</script>

	<br>
  <br>
  <br>
	<!-- Why should we only use document.write for testing? Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded will delete all existing HTML!-->
	<button onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Push me to delete everything but the number eleven</button>

	<!-- OH NOES! Better reload the browser! But First:-->

  <!-- TO DO: Change the code above so only your name and age show in the browser, instead of 11. Take a screenshot (press command + shift + 3), rename the image to documentWrite.png, put it in this folder (jsFun), and push back up to your branch on GitHub-->

  <br>

  <br>

	<h4> Using console.log</h4>
	<p>Check out the code for this part!</p>

	<!-- console.log is super handy for debugging purposes. Remember, to view your console, press command + option + j to open developer tools- then you will see the value printed in your console-->

	<!--***HINT: Did you notice how I needed to type in an extra space at the end of my sentence (also known as 'string') so that the numeral wouldn't smush into it when we print to console?-->
	<script>
		console.log('Hi! I am here in your console with the number eleven! ' + (5 + 6));
	</script>

<!-- TO DO: Print 'Hi from the console! This is ' + YOURNAME displayed in your browser console. Take a screenshot (press command + shift + 3), rename the image to console.png, put it in this (jsFun) folder, and push back up to your branch on GitHub-->

	<h3>Using HTML id and innerHTML</h3>

	<p>Here's a number:</p>
	<!-- the HTML "id" attribute defines the element on the page -->
	<p id='demo'></p>
	<!-- The innerHTML property defines the of that HTML element.  Here, we're setting it equal to 8 -->
	<script>
		document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 3 + 5;
	</script>

<!-- TO DO: Make "My name is" + your name and "My birthday is" + your birthday appear on the page. 
	***HINT: Remember, Javascript can only parse words when they are in 'string' format!!!***-->

	<!-- YOUR CODE GOES HERE!  -->

  <br>

	<h3>Using window.alert</h3>
	<p>Check out the code for this part!</p>

	<!-- Uncomment the following three lines of code (using the command + / keys) to see how to make an alert pop up! -->

<!-- <script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>
-->

<!-- TO DO: Make "Hi! My name is" + your name appear in an alert from the page. 
	***HINT: Remember, Javascript can only parse words when they are in 'string' format...d even punctuation (like quotation marks) must be inside of single quotes!!!***-->

	<h3>Changing the Value of an Attribute</h3>

	<p>
		When you wish to change the value of an HTML attribute, use this method:
  </p>
		<h4>document.getElementById(id).attribute = new value</h4>
  <p>
		The following example changes the value of the "src" attribute of an "img" element.  Time to flip back over to your text editor!
	</p>

<!-- Uncomment the script and p tags below the image tag, and then save this file.  Reload the page in your browser to see how it works!-->	

 <img id="image" src="images/smiley.gif" width="160" height="120">

<!-- <script>
document.getElementById("image").src = "images/landscape.jpg";
</script>

<p>The original image was smiley.gif, but the script changed it to landscape.jpg</p> -->
<br>
<br>

<h3>Writing a Function to Change the Value of an Attribute</h3>

<p>Now, let's make a simple Javascript function to switch between images.</p>

<!-- Ordinarily, we would put Javascript in its own file, but here we will include it "inline" with the HTML  -->

<script>
//this is where we declare the function
var pictureChange = function() {
	//here, we will grab the image id and change the picture
  document.getElementById('theImage').src = 'images/cat.gif';
};
</script>
<!-- Here is the image tag- we will use this id  -->
<img id="theImage" src='images/smiley.gif' width="160" height="120">
<!-- Here is the button- it calls our Javascript function when clicked  -->
<p><input type="button" id="theButton" value="click me to change the picture!" onclick=pictureChange()></p>

<br>
<br>
<!-- TO DO: 
Find two images, and make your own picture switcher below
-->

<!-- YOUR CODE GOES HERE!  -->



<!-- BACK TO THE ASSIGNMENT!  -->

<h3>Making a Picture Flipper with HTML and JS</h3>

<p>Let's use what we've learned to build a simple image viewer that will switch between an array of images.</p>

<script>
//make an array containing your images
var myPictures = ['images/banana1.gif', 'images/hackerman.gif', 'images/pizza.gif', 'images/imDead.jpg', 'images/bandRecital.jpg', 'images/yTho.jpg', 'images/questions.jpg', 'images/wifiDown.jpg', 'images/coffinSkate.jpg', 'images/$10words.jpg'];

//set the count at zero- this way, we will be sure to start at the beginning of our array of images
var picsIndex = 0;

//write a function to flip between images in the array
var changePicture = function () {
	//define our image variable- this will be the image id
  var img = document.getElementById('picture');

  //our index starts at O; we want to increment upward for as many images as there are in the myPictures array. If you had 5 pictures in your array, the line would read:
  // picsIndex = ++picsIndex % 5;
  picsIndex = ++picsIndex % 10;
  //here, we set the image source equal to the index position in myPictures dictated by current count value of picsIndex
  img.src = myPictures[picsIndex];
};
</script>

<img id='picture' src='images/smiley.gif' width="160" height="120">

<p><input type="button" id='button2' value="click me to flip through some pictures!" onclick=changePicture()></p>

<br>
<br>

<!-- TO DO: 
Find some images, and make your own picture flipper below.
-->

<!-- YOUR CODE GOES HERE!  -->
